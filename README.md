Welcome to the Animation Curves function library!

GameMaker 2024.2 required as this version fixes several issues with animation curves.

Inside the sample project there is a debug menu where you can try out the different available functions. There are operations that require two curves.
In some cases you need to provide a channel as an argument, in others just a set of points.

The functions provided to add and remove points will make sure that the array remains viable for animation curves.
If there is any function you would like to see you can look me up as Delfos in the main GameMaker Discord server or in the GameMaker Kitchen server.

Enjoy!
